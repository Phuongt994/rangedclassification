25.06.16

1) Refactor all into 2 main Packages:

- Elements: contain items
    Classes: Attributes, Classes
- Tools: contain methods
    Classes: Analyser, DScanner

Starter as Main()

--- ** ---

2) Current progress to analysing ranges:

- Starter initialised, which initialises (tool) DScanner
- DScanner initialised, which initialises (elements) Attributes & Classes
- DScanner invokes (methods) MaxMin, MaxSum, MinThresh

--- ** ---

Random updates:
1) Self-complication is when there are more classes than methods. Not. Good.
2) Hello post-Brexit
3) Missed a hackday.. tremendous guilt ensued
